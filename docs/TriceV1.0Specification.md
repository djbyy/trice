# *Trice*  Version 1.0 Specification (Draft)

##  1. <a name='Preface'></a>Preface

The with name "COBS" branded [*Trice* v0.48.0 encoding](./TriceMessagesEncoding.md) is not optimal concerning the generated data amount:
* See discussion [#253 Save trice COBS encoded data on target and view it later on PC](https://github.com/rokath/trice/discussions/253).
* The location information is transmitted as 16 bit file ID plus 16 bit line number. It is possible to generate during `trice update` an additional file `li.json` containing the location information for each *Trice* ID avoiding the additional 4 bytes this way. But this could cause assignment issues, when the same *Trice* ID is used at different locations (see [https://github.com/rokath/trice/discussions/264](https://github.com/rokath/trice/discussions/264)). But it is possible to drop the option `trice u -sharedIDs`.
* The 32-bit COBS package descriptor is overkill for allowing user data.
* The additional padding bytes to achieve 32 bit sizes are not needed. The user could add them by himself if really needed.
* The 4 timestamp bytes in front of each *Trice* demand the COBS package descriptor. The timestamp should go inside the *Trice* message and be optionally smaller.

##  2. <a name='Compatibility'></a>Compatibility

* The *Trice* v0.48.0 user syntax will remain mainly unchanged. The letter case of the ID codes the target timestamp size. (see below)
* The as "COBS" branded legacy [v0.48.0 *Trice* encoding](.TriceMessageEncoding.md) will stay unchanged as an option for compatibility. But it will not be the default encoding anymore. To use newer **trice** tool versions with legacy projects the CLI switch `-encoding LegacyCOBS` needs to be used.
* The option `-sharedIDs` will be further available but depreciated to avoid location assignment issues.
* Legacy projects which used the option `-sharedIDs` will still work even with a `li.json` file. A several times used ID will get an assignment of one of the locations.
* The issue [#242 Add target context option](https://github.com/rokath/trice/issues/242) could get the label "wontfix". When a task ID is needed, it could be also a data value in such cases.
* The same user source files usable with the legacy *Trice* COBS encoding and the proposed additional [TREX](#TREXTriceextendableencoding) encoding. The `#define TRICE_FILE Id(n)` is ignored when TREX is used.

##  3. <a name='Framing'></a>Framing

Framing will be done with [TCOBS](./TCOBSSpecification.md) for data reduction. As a pre-v1.0 version normal COBS will be used. For robustness each *Trice* gets its own TCOBS package. User data are in separate TCOBS packages encoded. When *Trices* are accumulated in a double half buffer, their separation in TCOBS packages is possible until the first extended *Trice*. Because of the generally unknown extended *Trice* length from this point, all following *Trices* in this half buffer need to go in one TCOBS package (including optional padding bytes) what is ok. The only disadvantage with this is, that in case of a data disruption at this place, several *Trice* messages can get lost.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

##  4. <a name='TriceIDlisttil.json'></a>*Trice* ID list `til.json`

This file integrates all firmware variants and versions as v0.48.0 does. For the implementation of the optional *Trice* extensions (see below), a `til.json` format extension is needed because several files are unhandy. Both `til.json` formats will be accepted in the future.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

##  5. <a name='Tricelocationinformationfileli.json'></a>*Trice* location information file `li.json`

With [TREX](#TREXTriceextendableencoding) encoding the location information needs no transmission anymore but goes not into the `til.json` file. In the field the location information is normally useless and easy outdated. The software developer is the one, mostly interested in the location information. So, if the `li.json` is generated and therefore available, the **trice** tool automatically displays file name and line number. When the firmware left the developer table, only the file `til.json` is of interest. The **trice** tool will silently not display location information, if the `li.json` file is not found. For in-field logging, the usage of option `-showID string` could be used. This allows later an easy location of the relevant source code. Also the planned `-binaryLogfile` option is possible. See [issue #267 Add `-binaryLogfile` option](https://github.com/rokath/trice/issues/267). It allows a replay of the logs and the developer can provide the right version of the `li.json` file.

##  6. <a name='TREXTriceextendableencoding'></a>TREX (*Trice* extendable) encoding

###  6.1. <a name='Symbols'></a>Symbols

* `i` = ID bit
* `I` = `iiiiiiii` = ID byte
* `n` = number bit
* `s` = selector bit
* `N` = `snnnnnnnn` = number byte
* `c` = cycle counter bit
* `C` = s==0 ? `cccccccc` : `nnnnnnnn` = cycle counter byte or number byte extension
* `t` = timestamp bit
* `T` = `tttttttt` = timestamp byte
* `d` = data bit
* `D` = `dddddddd` = data byte
* `...` = 0 to 32767 data bytes
* `"..."` = format string

###  6.2. <a name='Mainstreamlogs'></a>Main stream logs

* [x] As a compromize between speed and space a 16-bit wide *Trice* storage access is implemented. This also fits good for 8, 16 and 32 bit MCUs.
* [x] All main stream logs share the same 14 bit ID space allowing 1-16383 IDs in 3 variants parallel usable:

| 16-bit groups            | *Trice* code                 | Comment                                         |
| :-                       | -                            | -                                               |
| `01iiiiiiI NC  ...`      | `TRICE( id(n), "...", ...);` | *Trice* format without     timestamp |
| `10iiiiiiI TT NC ...`    | `TRICE( Id(n), "...", ...);` | *Trice* format with 16-bit timestamp |
| `11iiiiiiI TT TT NC ...` | `TRICE( ID(n), "...", ...);` | *Trice* format with 32-bit timestamp |

* Technically it is possible to have distinct ID spaces for each ID type but this would give no real advantage and complicate the handling only.
* [x] For straight forward runtime code, the identifiers `id`, `Id` and `ID` are sub macros:
  * [ ] **id(n)**
  
  ```c
  #define id(n) do{ TRICE_PUT16(0x4000 | n ); }while(0),
  ```

  * [ ] **Id(n)**

  ```c
  #define Id(n) do{ uint16_t ts = timestamp16;
                  TRICE_PUT16(0x8000 | n ); 
                  TRICE_PUT16( ts ); }while(0),
  ```

  * [ ] **ID(n)**

  ```c
  #define ID(n) do{ uint32_t ts = timestamp32;
                  TRICE_PUT16(0xC000 | n ); 
                  TRICE_PUT32( ts ); }while(0),
  ```

* [ ] Usage:

```c
#define T8(id, pFmt, v0) TRICE_ENTER; id; TRICE_PUT16(v0); TRICE_LEAVE;
```

* [x] New *Trice* macros are writable without the ID, so when `trice u` is executed a CLI switch controls the ID type selection:
  * The update switch `-timeStamp 32` defaults new ID´s to `ID`.
  * The update switch `-timeStamp 16` defaults new ID´s to `Id`.
  * The update switch `-timeStamp 0`  defaults new ID´s to `id`.
  * The update switch `-timeStamp to32` converts all `id` and `Id` to `ID`.
  * The update switch `-timeStamp to16` converts all `id` and `ID` to `Id`.
  * The update switch `-timeStamp to0`  converts all `ID` and `Id` to `id`.
* [x] `trice log`:
  * The log switch `-ttsf` is the same as `-ttsf32`.
  * There is a new log switch `ttsf16` for the 16 bit timestamps.
  * The `trice` tool alignes *Trice` messages with different timestamp sizes.

####  6.2.1. <a name='Triceformat'></a>*Trice* format

* Parameter data bytes start after the optional timestamp.
* N is the parameter data bytes count. Padding bytes are not counted.
* Usually N is < 127 but for buffer or string transfer N can get up to 32767 (15 bits).
* When N > 127 (s==1) `NC` is replaced by `1nnnnnnn nnnnnnnn`. C is incremented with each *Trice* but not transmitted when:
    * N > 127
    * extended *Trice* without C

####  6.2.2. <a name='FramingTCOBSorCOBSencodingandoptionalencryption'></a>Framing (TCOBS or COBS encoding) and optional encryption

* Inside double buffer each *Trice* starts at a u16 boundary.
* The encoding drops the padding bytes using N and encodes each *Trice* separately. This minimizes data loss in case of disruptions for example caused by reset. If size minimizing matters hard, several *Trices* are codable as group also, but this leads to more data losses in case of disruptions.

###  6.3. <a name='ExtendedTricesasfutureoption'></a>Extended *Trices* as future option

If for special cases, the main stream encoding is not sufficient, the user can add its own encoding.

* `00...` sub-options `TRICEX0`, `TRICEX1`, `TRICEX2`, `TRICEX3`
  * `-ex0 pos -ex1 pos -ex2 pos -ex3 pos`  Select position in extendable table for TRICEXn, 4 coding's selectable in one shot.
  * The table is creatable and extendable on demand.
  * For each line an appropriate target and host code needs to be done.
  * Then the target configuration must match the CLI switches.
  * Table example:
    |Position | Encoding                          | Remarks                                       |
    | -   | -                                     | -                                             |
    | pos | `00nniiii I D D`                      | 12 bit ID, no timestamp, 1x 16 bit data       |

    | pos | `00nniidd dddddddd`                   | 2 bit ID & 1x 10 bit data                     |
    |   6 | `00nndddd dddddddd`                   | no ID, 12 bit data as a 5 and a 7 bit value   |
    | pos | `00nndddd`                            | no ID, 4x 1 bit data                          |
    | pos | `00nniiii I`                          | 12 bit ID, no data                            |
    | pos | `00nniiii D D`                        | 4 bit ID, 1x 16 bit data                      |
    | pos | `00nniiii I D D`                      | 12 bit ID, 2x 8 bit data                      |
    | pos | `00nniiii I T T`                      | 12 bit ID, 16 bit timestamp, no data          |
    | pos | `00nniiii D D T`                      | ...                                           |
    |  13 | `00nniiii C T T  D D D D`             | 8 bit cyle counter, 16 bit timestamp, a float |
    | pos | `00nniiii C D D  T T T T`             | ...                                           |
    | pos | `00nniiii I D D  T`                   | ...                                           |
    | pos | `00nniiii tttttttt ttttdddd dddddddd` | 4 bit ID, 12 bit timestamp, 12 bit data       |
    | ... | `00nn...`                             | ...                                           |
  * Examples:
    * `-ex0 13` means TRICEX0 = `0000iiii C T T  D D D D`.
      * Usage: `TRICEX0( "result %f\n", aFloat(v));`
    * `-ex2 6`  means TRICEX2 = `0010dddd dddddddd`.
      * Usage: `TRICEX2( "point %x,%d\n", a, b);`
  * *Trice* extensions without cycle counter are counted as well.
  * Each TRICEXn has its own ID space.
* Several different *Trice* extensions are contributive.

###  6.4. <a name='Unknownuserdata'></a>Unknown user data

* Unknown user data are possible as part of the *Trice* extensions.
  * Without the `-ex0` switch, `0000...` packages are ignored as unknown user data.
  * Without the `-ex1` switch, `0001...` packages are ignored as unknown user data.
  * Without the `-ex2` switch, `0010...` packages are ignored as unknown user data.
  * Without the `-ex3` switch, `0011...` packages are ignored as unknown user data.
* So, if *Trice* extensions not used, all `00...` packages are ignored as unknown user data.
* Unknown user data have an unknown length. Therefore they cannot share a COBS packet with *Trices*.
* Unknown user data packets do not affect the cycle counter. The can have their own cycle counter.
