##  1. <a name='Preface'></a>Preface

* This technique needs to be considered as experimental:
  * RTT works good with a SEGGER J-Link debug probe but needs some closed source software components.
  * Also ST-Link is usable, but maybe not parallel with debugging.
  * Most investigations where done with a [NUCLEO64-STM32F030R8 evaluation board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f030r8.html) which contains an on-board debug probe reflashed with a SEGGER J-Link OB software (see below).

##  2. <a name='Fortheimpatient2possibilities'></a>For the impatient (2 possibilities)

The default SEGGER tools only suport RTT channel 0.

###  2.1. <a name='StartJLinkcommanderandconnectoverTCP'></a>Start JLink commander and connect over TCP

* JLink.exe → `connect ⏎ ⏎ S ⏎` and keep it active.
  * You can control the target with `r[eset], g[o], h[alt]` and use other commands too.
  * ![./ref/JLink.exe.PNG](./ref/JLink.exe.PNG)
* Start Git-Bash or s.th. similar: `trice l -p TCP4 -args localhost:19021`
* You may need a **trice** tool restart after firmware reload.

###  2.2. <a name='StartusingJLinkLogger'></a>Start using JLinkLogger

* Start Git-Bash or s.th. similar: `trice l -p JLINK -args "-Device STM32F030R8 -if SWD -Speed 4000 -RTTChannel 0`
  * Replace CLI details with your settings.
* You may **not** need a **trice** tool restart after firmware reload.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

##  3. <a name='SeggerRealTimeTransferRTT'></a>Segger Real Time Transfer (RTT) 

* Prerequisite is a processor with memory background access support like ARM Cortex-M cores.
* If you can use a Segger J-Link or an STM ST-Link debug probe (ST Microelectronics eval boards have it) this is an easy and fast way to use *Trice* without any UART or other port.
* Detailed description can be found in document [UM08001_JLink.pdf](../third_party/segger.com/UM08001_JLink.pdf) in chapter 16 which is part of [https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack).
* Following examples are for Windows, but should work similar also on Linux and Darwin (MacOS).
* *Trice* can use the Segger RTT protocol in different ways.
  * Hardware paths:
    * Use [J-Link](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/) or [J-Link OB (on-board)](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-ob/).
      J-Link OB can be flashed to many ST Microelectronics evaluation boards (v2.0 link hardware) and for example is also usable with NXP and Atmel. For that you can also use a spare STM32 evaluation board (10 EUR) with jumper changes and breakout wires.
    * Use ST-Link with [gostlink](../third_party/goST/ReadMe.md).
      It uses only one USB endpoint so debugging and trice output in parallel is not possible.
    * Use some other Debug-Probe with target memory access (support welcome)
  * RTT channel selection (on target and on host)
    * RECOMMENDED:
      * `trice l -p JLINK` or shorter `trice l` for STM32F030R8 (default port is JLINK) starts in background a `JLinkRTTLogger.exe` which connects to J-Link and writes to a logfile which in turn is read by the **trice** tool. On exit the `JLinkRTTLogger.exe` is killed automatically.
        * It expects a target sending messages over RTT channel **0** (zero). Chapter 16.3.3 in [UM08001_JLink.pdf](../third_party/segger.com/UM08001_JLink.pdf) refers to "Up-Channel 1" but this maybe is a typo and probably a 0 is mend. The `JLinkRTTLogger.exe` main advantage against other free available SEGGER tools is, that all bytes are transferred. Other SEGGER tools assume ASCII characters and use `FF 00` to `FF 0F` as a terminal switch command and filter that out causing *Trice* data disturbances.
        * It should be possible to start several instances on on different targets using `-SelectEmuBySN <SN>` inside the `-args` *Trice* CLI switch.
        * `JLinkRTTLogger` binaries for Linux & Darwin can be found at [https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/).
      * `trice l -p STLINK` starts in background a `trice/third_party/goST/stRttLogger.exe` which connects to ST-Link and writes to a logfile which in turn is read by the trice tool. On exit the `stRttLogger.exe` is killed automatically. It expects a target sending messages over RTT channel 0 (other channels supported too but may not work).\
      It is possible to start several instances on different channels as well as on different targets. The source code is in [https://github.com/bbnote/gostlink](https://github.com/bbnote/gostlink) and should work also at least under Linux.
    * If you have the choice, prefer J-Link. It allows parallel debugging and trice output.
    * The full `-args` string is normally required and depends on the used device. Example: `trice l -args="-Device STM32F070RB -if SWD -Speed 4000 -RTTChannel 0 -RTTSearchRanges 0x20000000_0x1000"`. The `-RTTSearchRanges` part is mostly optional.
    * Enter `trice h -log` and read info for `-args` switch:

```bash
        -args string
        Use to pass port specific parameters. The "default" value depends on the used port:
        port "COMn": default="", use "TARM" for a different driver. (For baud rate settings see -baud.)
        port "J-LINK": default="-Device STM32F030R8 -if SWD -Speed 4000 -RTTChannel 0 -RTTSearchRanges 0x20000000_0x1000",
                The -RTTSearchRanges "..." need to be written without extra "" and with _ instead of space.
                For args options see JLinkRTTLogger in SEGGER UM08001_JLink.pdf.
        port "ST-LINK": default="-Device STM32F030R8 -if SWD -Speed 4000 -RTTChannel 0 -RTTSearchRanges 0x20000000_0x1000",
                The -RTTSearchRanges "..." need to be written without extra "" and with _ instead of space.
                For args options see JLinkRTTLogger in SEGGER UM08001_JLink.pdf.
        port "BUFFER": default="0 0 0 0", Option for args is any byte sequence.
         (default "default")
 ```

##  4. <a name='J-Linkoption'></a>J-Link option

* Prerequisite is a SEGGER J-Link debug probe or a development board with an on-board J-Link option.

###  4.1. <a name='ConvertaSTMNUCLEOorDISCOVERYonboardST-LinkvalidforST-Linkv2v2.1notforv3'></a>Convert a STM NUCLEO or DISCOVERY onboard ST-Link (valid for ST-Link v2 & v2.1, not for v3)

* Following steps describe the needed action for a ST Microelectronics evaluation board and windows - adapt them to your environment.
* It is always possible to turn back to the ST-Link OB firmware with the SEGGER `STLinkReflash.exe` tool but afterwards the ST-Link Upgrade tool should be used again to get the latest version. 

####  4.1.1. <a name='Firststeptodoifsomeissuesoccur-otherwiseyoucanskipit'></a>First step (to do if some issues occur - otherwise you can skip it)

* Get & install [STM32 ST-LINK utility](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html)
* Run from default install location `"C:\Program Files (x86)\STMicroelectronics\STM32 ST-LINKUtility\ST-LINK Utility\ST-LinkUpgrade.exe"`)
* Enable checkbox `Change Type` and select radio button `STM32 Debug+Mass storage + VCP`. *The `STM32Debug+ VCP` won´t be detected by Segger reflash utility.*
  ![ST-LINK-Upgrade.PNG](./ref/ST-LINK-Upgrade.PNG)

####  4.1.2. <a name='Secondstep'></a>Second step

* Check [Converting ST-LINK On-Board Into a J-Link](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/other-j-links/st-link-on-board/)
* Use `STLinkReflash.exe` to convert NUCLEO from ST-Link on-board to J-Link on-board. *`STM32 Debug+ VCP` won´t be detected by Segger reflash utility.*

###  4.2. <a name='SomeSEGGERtoolsinshort'></a>Some SEGGER tools in short

* Download [J-Link Software and Documentation Pack](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack) and install.
  * You may need to add `C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLink` to the %PATH% variable.
* Tested with [NUCLEO64-STM32F030R8 evaluation board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f030r8.html).
* For example: Compile and flash `../test/MDK-ARM_STM32F030R8` project.
  * Check in [../test/MDK-ARM_STM32F030R8/Core/Inc/triceConfig.h](../test/MDK-ARM_STM32F030R8/Core/Inc/triceConfig.h) if `#define TRICE_RTT_CHANNEL 0` is set as output option.

####  4.2.1. <a name='JLink.exe'></a>JLink.exe

* `JLink.exe` is the SEGGER J-Link commander. It starts the **J-Link driver/server** and one can connect to it
* Info found [here](https://gist.github.com/GaryLee/ecd8018d1ca046c1a40fcd265fa109c0):
  * J-Link Commander can be started with different command line options for test and automation
  * purposes. In the following, the command line options which are available for J-Link
  * Commander are explained. All command line options are case insensitive.
  * Command Explanation
  * -AutoConnect Automatically start the target connect sequence
  * -CommanderScript Passes a CommandFile to J-Link
  * -CommandFile Passes a CommandFile to J-Link
  * -Device Pre-selects the device J-Link Commander shall connect to
  * -ExitOnError Commander exits after error.
  * -If Pre-selects the target interface
  * -IP Selects IP as host interface
  * -JLinkScriptFile Passes a JLinkScriptFile to J-Link
  * -JTAGConf Sets IRPre and DRPre
  * -Log Sets logfile path
  * -RTTTelnetPort Sets the RTT Telnetport
  * -SelectEmuBySN Connects to a J-Link with a specific S/N over USB
  * -SettingsFile Passes a SettingsFile to J-Link
  * -Speed Starts J-Link Commander with a given initial speed
* Documentation: [https://wiki.segger.com/J-Link_Commander](https://wiki.segger.com/J-Link_Commander)
* If you run successful `jlink -device STM32F030R8 -if SWD -speed 4000 -autoconnect 1` the target is stopped.
  * To let in run you need manually execute `go` as command in the open jlink window.
  * To automate that create a text file named for example `jlink.go` containing the `go` command: `echo go > jlink.go` and do a `jlink -device STM32F030R8 -if SWD -speed 4000 -autoconnect 1 -CommandFile jlink.go`
* It is possible to see some output with Firefox (but not with Chrome?) for example: ![./ref/JLink19021.PNG](./ref/JLink19021.PNG).
* After closing the Firefox the **trice** tool can connect to it too:
  * Open a commandline and run:
    ```b
    trice log -port TCP4 -args localhost:19021
    ```
    * trice output is visible
    * With `h`alt and `g`o inside the Jlink window the MCU can get haltes and released
    * It is possible in parallel to debug-step with a debugger (tested with ARM-MDK)
* ![./ref/JLinkServer.PNG](./ref/JLinkServer.PNG)
* **PLUS:**
  * Works reliable.
  * No file interface needed.
  * *Trice* can connect over TCP localhost:19021 and display logs over RTT channel 0.
  * The open `jlink` CLI can be handy to control the target: `[r]eset, [g]o. [h]alt`
  * No need to restart the **trice** tool after changed firmware download.
* **MINUS:**
  * Uses RTT up-channel 0 and therefore RTT up-channel 0 is not usable differently.
  * No down-channel usable.
  * Needs a separate manual start of the `jlink` binary with CLI parameters.
    * I would not recommend to automate that too, because this step is needed only once after PC power on.

####  4.2.2. <a name='JLinkRTTLogger.exe'></a>JLinkRTTLogger.exe

* `JLinkRTTLogger.exe` is a CLI tool and connects via the SEGGER API to the target. It is usable for writing RTT channel 0 data from target into a file.
* **PLUS:**
  * Works reliable.
  * Is automatable.
  * Create file with raw log data: `JLinkRTTLogger.exe -Device STM32F030R8 -if SWD -Speed 4000 -RTTChannel 0 triceRaw.log`
    * It is possible to evaluate this file offline: `trice l -p FILE -args triceRaw.log`
    * ![./ref/TriceFILE.PNG](./ref/TriceFILE.PNG)
  * No need to restart the **trice** tool after changed firmware download.
* **MINUS:**
  * Logs in a file, so the **trice** tool needs to read from that file.
* The **trice** tool can watch the output file and display the *Trices*: `trice log -port JLINK -args "-Device STM32F030R8 -if SWD -Speed 4000 -RTTChannel 0"
![./ref/JlinkLoggerTrice.PNG](./ref/JlinkLoggerTrice.PNG)

###  4.3. <a name='JLinkRTTClient.exe'></a>JLinkRTTClient.exe

* `JLinkRTTClient.exe` can be used for simple text transmitting to the target, it also displays strings from target coming over channel 0. It is not used by the **trice** tool.
  * **PLUS:**
    * Target stimulation with proprietary protocol over RTT down-channel 0 possible.
  * **MINUS:**
    * Unfortunately it cannot run separately parallel to stimulate the target with any proprietary protocol because it connects to localhost:19021 and therefore blockades the only one possible connection.

###  4.4. <a name='JLinkRTTViewer.exe'></a>JLinkRTTViewer.exe

* `JLinkRTTViewer.exe` is a GUI tool and connects via the SEGGER API to the target. It expects ASCII codes and is not used by the **trice** tool. The switching between the 16 possible terminals is done via `FF 00` ... `FF 0F`. These byte pairs can occur inside the trice data.

<!---

* Start `"C:\Program Files (x86)\SEGGER\JLink\JLinkRTTViewer.exe"` and connect to the J-Link. You only need this as a running server to connect to.
  * Unfortunately the JLinkRTTViewer "steals" from time to time some trice data packages and displays them as data garbage.
  * Better use JLink.exe or the *Segger J-Link SDK* instead.

##  5. <a name='SeggerRTT'></a>Segger RTT

* The main advantages are:
  * Speed
  * No `TriceTransfer()` nor any interrupt is needed in the background
  * No UART or other output is needed
* This is, because automatically done by SeggerRTT. This way one can debug code as comfortable as with `printf()` but with all the TRICE advantages. Have a look here: ![SeggerRTTD.gif](./ref/JLINK-DebugSession.gif)
* Avoid trice buffering inside target and write with TRICE macro directly into the RTT buffer (direct *Trice* mode = `#define TRICE_MODE 0` inside [triceConfig.h](../test/MDK-ARM_STM32F030R8/Core/Inc/triceConfig.h)).
* Write the bytes per *Trice* directly (little time & some space overhead on target, but no changes on host side)

##  6. <a name='SeggerJ-LinkSDK800EUROption'></a>Segger J-Link SDK (~800 EUR) Option

* Segger offers a SeggerRTT SDK which allows to use more than just channel 0 and you can develop your own tooling with it.
* The `trice -port JLINK` is ok for usage **as is** right now. However if you wish more comfort check here:
* Question: [How-to-access-multiple-RTT-channels](https://forum.segger.com/index.php/Thread/6688-SOLVED-How-to-access-multiple-RTT-channels-from-Telnet/)
  * "Developer pack used to write your own program for the J-Link. Please be sure you agree to the terms of the associated license found on the Licensing Information tab before purchasing this SDK. You will benefit from six months of free email support from the time that this product is ordered."
* The main [Segger J-Link SDK](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/j-link-sdk/) disadvantage beside closed source and payment is: **One is not allowed to distribute binaries written with the SDK.** That makes it only interesting for company internal automatization.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

##  7. <a name='AdditionalNotesleftovers'></a>Additional Notes (leftovers)

* `Downloading RTT target package` from [https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/about-real-time-transfer/](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/about-real-time-transfer/).
* Read the manual [UM08001_JLink.pdf](../third_party/segger.com/UM08001_JLink.pdf).
* Extract `../third_party/segger.com/SEGGER_RTT_V760g.zip` to `../third_party/segger.com/SEGGER_RTT`. Check for an update @ SEGGER.
* Add `SEGGER_RTTI.c` to target project

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

##  8. <a name='Furtherdevelopment'></a>Further development

* Check OpenOCD!
  * Use OpenOCD and its built-in RTT feature. OpenOCD then starts a server on localhost:17001 where it dumps all RTT messages.
* The GoST project offers a way bypassing JLINK. Used -port STLINK instead.
* Maybe `libusb` together with `libjaylink` offer some options too.
* Checkout [https://github.com/deadsy/jaylink](https://github.com/deadsy/jaylink).
* `"C:\Program Files (x86)\SEGGER\JLink\JMem.exe"` shows a memory dump.

* Go to [https://libusb.info/](https://libusb.info/)
  * -> Downloads -> Latest Windows Binaries
  * extract `libusb-1.0.23` (or later version)

```b
libusb-1.0.23\examples\bin64> .\listdevs.exe
2109:2811 (bus 2, device 8) path: 6
1022:145f (bus 1, device 0)
1022:43d5 (bus 2, device 0)
0a12:0001 (bus 2, device 1) path: 13
1366:0105 (bus 2, device 10) path: 5
```

* Repeat without connected Segger JLink

```b
libusb-1.0.23\examples\bin64> .\listdevs.exe
2109:2811 (bus 2, device 8) path: 6
1022:145f (bus 1, device 0)
1022:43d5 (bus 2, device 0)
0a12:0001 (bus 2, device 1) path: 13
```

* In this case `1366:0105 (bus 2, device 10) path: 5` is missing, so `vid=1366`, `did=0105` as example
* On Windows install WSL2. The real Linux kernel is needed for full USB access.

Info: [https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f030r8.html](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f030r8.html)

###  9.1. <a name='RTTwithoriginalon-boardST-LINKfirmware'></a>RTT with original on-board ST-LINK firmware

* `#define TRICE_RTT_CHANNEL 0`:
* If you use a NUCLEO-F030R8 with the original ST-Link on board after firmware download enter: `trice l -p ST-LINK -args "-Device STM32F030R8 -if SWD -Speed 4000 -RTTChannel 0 -RTTSearchRanges 0x20000000_0x2000"`. After pressing the reset button output becomes visible: ![./ref/STRTT.PNG](./ref/STRTT.PNG)
* It works with both ST-Link variants (with or without mass storage device.)

![./ref/J-LinkRTT.PNG](./ref/J-LinkRTT.PNG)

- Observations:
  - When pressing the black reset button, you need to restart the **trice** tool.
  - When restarting the trice tool, a target reset occurs.
  - Other channel numbers than `0` seam not to work for some reason.
