# Reason for this directory - do not copy it in your project

* When executing (CGO) tests in `trice_test.go` the acompanying `triceConfig.h` could be beside the `trice.c` file.
* But, when compiling the examples, which have `trice.c` included the beside `triceConfig.h` is taken and not the `triceConfig.h` inside the example. The C-compiler looks first into the `*.c` file directory for headers and than into the include path.
* Putting `triceConfig.h` in a separate folder solves this. Also it is a bit more clear not to copy these files into the user project.
